# 🛷 Midnight Magic: Santa's Global Dash 🎅
An accessible, scroll-driven web experience following Santa's journey across the globe.
 Built for the [Hackathon Name] 2025.

## 🌟 The Vision
Midnight Magic is an interactive storytelling experience that follows Santa’s sleigh across the globe. Built for the Festive Frontend Hackathon, this project focuses on high-end UI/UX, scroll-driven animations, and celebrating global traditions.  It deliberately focuses on a small number of locations to ensure a polished, complete experience.
