            <p>A tradition centuries in the making! Since the Victorian era, Londoners have left sweet mince pies and a warming glass of sherry for Santa, with a carrot added for Rudolph since the 1940s to help him fly through the city fog.</p>

            <p>In France, families enjoy the Bûche de Noël. Before it was a delicious chocolate cake, the Bûche de Noël was a massive wooden log burned in French fireplaces for several days to protect the home from evil spirits. As modern heaters replaced hearths in the late 1800s, the log was reimagined as the iconic dessert we love today!</p>

            <p>A surprisingly modern tradition! Since a famous 'Kentucky for Christmas' marketing campaign in 1974, Japanese families celebrate with festive buckets of fried chicken and 'Kurisumasu Kyaki'—a light sponge cake topped with strawberries and cream that symbolizes the Japanese flag.</p>

            <p>The classic American treat: a tall glass of cold milk and a plate of delicious chocolate chip cookies. The 'Milk and Cookies' tradition took off during the 1930s Depression, as parents taught children to share and show gratitude for gifts during hard times. Today, Santa enjoys these treats against the backdrop of Manhattan’s iconic holiday window displays.</p>
