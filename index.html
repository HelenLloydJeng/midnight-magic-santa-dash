                <img src="assets/food/mince-pies.webp" alt="Mince Pies" class="food-img">
                <p>A tradition centuries in the making! Since the Victorian era, Londoners have left sweet mince pies
                    and a warming glass of sherry for Santa, with a carrot added for Rudolph since the 1940s to help him
                    fly through the city fog.</p>
                <p>Mince pies are Britain's favourite sweet snack for Christmas. the pastry is filled with fruit, spice,
                    and citrus.
                    The first pies were rectangular with baby Jesus on top, made with pastry.
                    The pies are made with 13 ingredients, representing Jesus' disciples, which is symbolic of the
                    Christmas story. Dried fruits, such as raisins, prunes, and figs, as well as lamb and mutton, were
                    among the ingredients used to represent shepherds. Spices like cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg were
                    also included to represent the wise men.
                    For good luck, stir in a clockwise direction, always make a wish when eating your first pie of the
                    Christmas season, and never cut a pie with a knife.

                <p>In France, families enjoy the Bûche de Noël. Before it was a delicious chocolate cake, the Bûche de
                    Noël was a massive wooden log burned in French fireplaces for several days to protect the home from
                    evil spirits. As modern heaters replaced hearths in the late 1800s, the log was reimagined as the
                    iconic dessert we love today!</p>

                <p>The classic American treat: a tall glass of cold milk and a plate of delicious chocolate chip
                    cookies. The 'Milk and Cookies' tradition took off during the 1930s Depression, as parents taught
                    children to share and show gratitude for gifts during hard times. Today, Santa enjoys these treats
                    against the backdrop of Manhattan’s iconic holiday window displays.</p>
